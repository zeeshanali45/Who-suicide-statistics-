# Executive Summary: WHO Suicide Statistics Analysis

## Dataset Overview
- Source: WHO Suicide Statistics
- Time period: 1979-2016
- 141 countries represented
- 43,776 entries with 6 columns: country, year, sex, age, suicides_no, population

## Key Findings

### 1. Global Trends
- Total population analyzed: 65,839,692,243
- Suicide rates increased steadily from 1980 to 2000, with a slight decline thereafter

### 2. Gender Disparity
- Males show significantly higher suicide rates compared to females
- Statistical analysis confirms this difference is significant (t-test p-value < 0.05)

### 3. Age Group Analysis
- The 35-54 age group exhibits the highest number of suicides
- Mean suicides by age group:
  * 35-54 years: 397.57
  * 55-74 years: 269.15
  * 25-34 years: 188.13
  * 15-24 years: 135.63
  * 75+ years: 104.57
  * 5-14 years: 9.40
- ANOVA test confirms significant differences in suicide rates across age groups (p-value < 0.05)

### 4. Top Countries
- Russian Federation accounts for the highest percentage (18.63%) of global suicides

### 5. Population and Suicide Correlation
- Strong positive correlation (0.884) between population size and number of suicides
- Linear regression analysis shows:
  * Minimal positive effect of population on suicide numbers
  * Slight decrease in suicides over time (approximately 1 fewer suicide per year)

### 6. Standardized Suicide Rates
- Calculated suicide rates per 100,000 population reveal:
  * Higher rates in smaller populations, especially among older age groups
  * Example: Zimbabwe (1990), 25-34 male group shows a high rate of 39.41 per 100,000

## Implications and Recommendations
1. Targeted interventions for males and the 35-54 age group are crucial
2. Special attention needed for countries with high suicide percentages, particularly the Russian Federation
3. While larger populations have more suicides, the relationship isn't directly proportional; other factors are likely at play
4. Mental health strategies should consider age-specific risk factors
5. Further investigation into the slight decrease in suicide rates over time could inform effective prevention strategies

## Limitations and Future Research
- Data quality varies across countries and years; some entries had missing values
- Further analysis of socioeconomic factors, mental health policies, and cultural aspects could provide deeper insights
- Longitudinal studies tracking changes in suicide rates alongside policy implementations could be valuable

This analysis provides a foundation for understanding global suicide trends and identifying high-risk groups, which can inform targeted mental health interventions and policy decisions.
